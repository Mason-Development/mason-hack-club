      <h2 class="text-center">Isn't hacking bad?</h2>
      <p>For some people, the word "hack" is associated with things like breaking into bank accounts. However, that's not <i>really</i> hacking. When we say hack, we mean finding a creative solution to a problem (think of life hacks!) using technology--no
        banks involved!</p>

      <p>We'll be taking you through a course where you learn to create your very own website. After that, you'll have the opportunity to split into groups and design a website to market a product! We'll be including fun, non-coding activities to keep you
        moving.</p>
